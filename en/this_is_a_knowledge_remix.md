## This is a knowledge remix

Just as in the Bitcoin ecosystem, in the beginning, there was quite a bit of knowledge fragmentatation - one blog post here, a forum post tutorial there, a misleading article there and so on. 

This book represents a mashup of wiki pages, tutorials and other relevant information that so far has been scattered  without an easy way to find and access it. 

###The aim of this work

This guide tries to create an **easy to access ethereum knowledge base** that can help people from all around the world to **start experimenting with blockchain technologies**.

Hopefully through this work, we will get closer to a reality in which we all realize that as long as we experiment with blockchain related technologies, we enrich the decentralized ecosystem in our own unique ways - contributing to something bigger than any individual project or initiative.
